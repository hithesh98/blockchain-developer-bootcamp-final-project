## POAP-Networking
### Problem 😕
Meeting people in the virtual world can be hard. A reason people go to events is to meet and network with people that are attending the event. However, facilitating introductions on virtual events are often limited to breakout rooms in Zoom. Breakout rooms only last for the duration of time the event organisers have scheduled for it. How do you facilitate and incentivise networking between your attendees? 
### Solution💡
One possible solution is to issue a POAP token to anyone who attends the event. Using this POAP token as a ticket for a matchmaking service that randomly matches you to another attendee. 
### Outcome🌍
- Event organisers who implement this solution give people more incentive to attend.
- Provided POAP tokens are distributed correctly, it allows a way to network with people who verifiably attended the event.
- Expanding out the service - reputational points can be rewarded for meeting with people and a trail of how big your network starts accruing on-chain. Other than social status, it could allow you to build a digital identity network of people you met in the virtual world. 
### Project Scope 🎯
As part of the final project, I will be building the part of the solution that allows people to enter the matchmaking service.
### Workflow💻
1. User visits the DApp.
2. They connect using their wallet.
3. The DApp displays all of their POAP tokens.
4. They select which POAP token they want to network with.
5. They enter a communication method (e.g email).
6. Correspondence is sent to their communication channel with the details of the meeting.
